      <h2>Why Supplements Matter Today</h2>
      <p>
        In a perfect world, we’d get everything we need from food alone — and historically, we did. But modern farming practices have significantly depleted the mineral and nutrient content of our soil, and many foods today are grown for yield and shelf life rather than nutrient density. We often fall short on key vitamins and minerals the body needs to function optimally. These thoughtfully chosen supplements aren’t meant to replace good food or a healthy lifestyle — they’re meant to fill the gaps, support normal biological processes, and help the body do what it was designed to do in a modern environment that no longer supports it naturally.
      </p>

    <!-- Core Essentials -->

      <h2>Core Essentials</h2>

      <p><strong>Here are the essential vitamins your body NEEDS:</strong></p>

      <ul>

      <h3>Mineral-rich Sea Salt: <a href="https://bajagoldsaltco.com/?rfsn=7765121.6c05cbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baja Gold Salt Co</a></h3>
      <p>
        Minerals are foundational to hydration, nerve signaling, muscle function, and energy production — yet most people are deficient due to depleted soil and over-filtered water. Unlike processed table salt, natural sea salt contains a full spectrum of trace minerals that help water actually enter your cells, improving hydration rather than depleting it.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start your day with a glass of water + ½ tsp mineral-rich salt... Contrary to popular belief, the right salt helps hydrate you.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Methylated Multivitamin</h3>
      <p>
        A high-quality, methylated multivitamin provides the body with bioavailable forms of essential vitamins and minerals needed for energy production, detox pathways, brain health, immune function, and cellular repair. Methylated forms are especially important because many people cannot properly convert synthetic vitamins into usable forms.

      <h3>Omega 3 Fatty Acids</h3>
      <p>
        Omega-3s are critical for reducing inflammation, supporting heart and brain health, maintaining healthy joints, and protecting blood vessels. Most modern diets are severely deficient in omega-3s and overloaded with inflammatory omega-6 fats, creating an imbalance that stresses the body over time. Supplementing with a clean, plant-based omega-3 helps restore that balance and supports long-term cardiovascular and metabolic health.

      </p>

      <h3>Amino Acids</h3>
      <p>
        Amino acids are the building blocks of protein — and therefore of muscles, bones, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, skin, and immune cells. Even people who eat enough protein may not be getting the right balance of essential amino acids needed for repair and regeneration, especially as we age. Supplementing essential amino acids ensures the body has the raw materials it needs for daily repair, strength, and resilience — without taxing digestion.

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Potential Add-Ons</h2>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <strong>Magnesium:</strong> Supports muscle and nerve function, energy production, sleep quality, and stress regulation, and plays a critical role in hundreds of enzymatic processes throughout the body. Modern diets are often low in magnesium due to soil depletion and food processing, making it one of the most common nutrient gaps today. For most people, a quality multivitamin provides some magnesium, but not enough for optimal stress support, sleep, or muscle relaxation. A great add-on if needed:
          <a href="https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/magnesium-glycinate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Magnesium glycinate</strong></a>
          (200–300 mg daily)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <strong>Vitamin D3 and K2:</strong> Work together to support bone strength, immune function, and cardiovascular health.  For most people, a quality multivitamin already covers daily needs for vitamin D and K2. You may want to add a separate D3/K2 if you are post-menopausal, low in vitamin D, have heart health concerns, or are actively working on bone health. A great add-on if needed:
          <a href="https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/vitamin-d-k2-liquid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Thorne Liquid Vitamin D + K2</strong></a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Supports immune defense, collagen production, skin health, blood vessel integrity, and antioxidant protection. For most people, a quality multivitamin already covers daily needs for vitamin C. Vitamin C needs fluctuate based on demand - You may want to add extra vitamin C if you:  Get sick frequently or are fighting off an illness; Are under high physical or emotional stress; Have increased inflammation or slower healing; Want additional support for skin, joints, or connective tissue. A great add-on if needed:
          <a href="https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/vit-c-w-flavonoids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Thorne Vitamin C</strong></a>

      </div>

      <div class="note">
  <p>
    <strong>Coconut Cult (Probiotic Coconut Yogurt):</strong>
    Coconut Cult is one of the most potent probiotic foods available, delivering an exceptionally high
    concentration of live beneficial bacteria in a whole-food, fermented form. Unlike many probiotics
    that are encapsulated and must survive stomach acid, fermented foods introduce microbes in a way
    the body recognizes and absorbs naturally.
  </p>
  <p>
    A healthy gut microbiome plays a central role in digestion, immune function, hormone balance,
    inflammation control, and even mood regulation through the gut-brain axis. Coconut Cult is especially
    helpful for those avoiding dairy while still wanting robust probiotic support.

  <p>
    <strong>Molecular Hydrogen:</strong>
    Molecular hydrogen is a unique, selective antioxidant that targets the most damaging free radicals
    without interfering with beneficial cellular signaling. This makes it especially supportive for
    reducing oxidative stress, calming inflammation, and protecting mitochondrial function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people use molecular hydrogen to support energy levels, recovery, cognitive clarity, and
    overall cellular resilience—particularly during periods of stress or increased demand.

      <h3>For the Allergy Sufferers Out There</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>NAC:</strong> This helps thin mucus, so it doesn’t build up or drip into your throat. Best taken earlier in the day.

        <strong>Quercetin Complex:</strong> This keeps your sinuses calm and open, so you sleep better. Best taken in the evening.

    <!-- What to Avoid -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>What to Avoid</h2>

      <p><strong>❌ Folic Acid</strong><br/>
  Folic acid is a <strong>synthetic, man-made nutrient</strong> that does not exist in nature.
  It is not the same as folate, which is the naturally occurring form found in real food.
  Folic acid is heavily added to the modern food supply—sprayed onto grains, cereals,
  pastas, rice, and processed foods under the labels “fortified” or “enriched.”
  While this practice was intended to prevent deficiency, it has created a very different problem.
</p>

<p>
  An estimated <strong>44% of the population cannot properly convert folic acid into its active form,
  methylfolate</strong>, due to common genetic variations (such as MTHFR).
  When this conversion does not occur efficiently, folic acid can accumulate in the body in an
  unusable form—leading to a <em>functional folate deficiency</em> even when intake appears high.
</p>

<p>
  This disruption has been linked to mood disorders, anxiety, depression, gut issues,
  cognitive challenges, and behavioral concerns in children.
  It is also considered a major contributor to <strong>postpartum depression</strong>,
  as many prenatal vitamins still rely on folic acid instead of bioavailable methylfolate—
  placing additional stress on an already vulnerable nervous system.
</p>

<p>
  For this reason, it’s important to <strong>avoid foods and supplements labeled “fortified” or
  “enriched” with folic acid</strong>, and to choose supplements that contain
  <em>methylfolate</em> instead.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Recommended prenatal:</strong>
  <a href="https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/basic-prenatal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Thorne Basic Prenatal
  </a>
  — formulated with active, bioavailable folate to support maternal and fetal health without overwhelming the body.
</p>

      
      <p><strong>❌ Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)</strong><br/>
        Cyanocobalamin is a cheap, synthetic form of B12 that requires conversion... making it less efficient and more taxing than active forms.
      </p>

      <p><strong>❌ Pyridoxine HCl (Vitamin B6)</strong><br/>
        This inactive form of B6 must be converted into its active form... and in excess can contribute to nerve irritation instead of supporting nervous system health.
      </p>

      <p><strong>❌ dl-Alpha Tocopherol (Synthetic Vitamin E)</strong><br/>
        This synthetic form is not as effective... and does not provide the same cardiovascular benefits as mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols.
      </p>

      <p><strong>❌ Artificial Colors, Sweeteners, and “Candy-Like” Gummies</strong><br/>
        These often contain cheap dyes, additives, and sugars that can disrupt blood sugar, gut health, and absorption.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Free Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a really cool (and free!) website called
        <a href="https://supp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>supp.co</strong></a>
        ... that helps you keep track of all the supplements you’re taking in one place. You plug in your vitamins, and it automatically totals everything up — showing if you’re low, right on target, or possibly getting too much of anything. It also scores supplement quality and ingredients, which is amazing for cutting through marketing noise. I’ve been using it to double-check my own routine, and it’s been super helpful for clarity and peace of mind. No pressure at all — just a really great tool if you want an easy, organized way to see how everything fits together.
