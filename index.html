        Welcome to my carefully curated collection of clean living recommendations—based on years of trial,
        error, and a relentless quest to live as toxin-free, grounded, and naturally well as possible.
        My goal is to make this simple, practical, and doable — not overwhelming.

  <h2><span class="emoji">🌊</span> Water</h2>

  <p>
    Water is the foundation of health, yet most people assume their tap water is safe simply because it’s regulated.
    In reality, municipal water standards are often based on outdated thresholds that prioritize feasibility over long-term health.
    Many public water supplies contain a complex mix of contaminants—such as arsenic, industrial chemicals, disinfection byproducts,
    pharmaceuticals, and agricultural runoff—that may be present at levels deemed “legal,” but not necessarily optimal for human biology.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most eye-opening resources available is the
    <a href="https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/" target="_blank"><strong>Environmental Working Group (EWG)</strong></a>,
    a nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer health and environmental transparency.
    EWG maintains a public database that allows you to look up exactly what’s in your local tap water—based on real testing data
    from utilities across the country. When I first searched my own area, I was shocked to see arsenic levels above
    health-based guidelines, along with several other contaminants I had never heard mentioned before.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clean, mineral-rich water supports hydration, detoxification, cellular function, and overall vitality.
    For those unable to access natural spring water, choosing the <em>right</em> filtration system becomes critical—because not all
    filters actually remove the most harmful contaminants. In fact, many popular brands provide a false sense of security while
    leaving significant toxins behind.

    Education is the first step. Once you know what you’re working with, you can make informed choices that align with your body’s
    needs—without perfection or panic.

    <section id="air" class="section">
      <h2>🌬️ Air</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor air — especially in modern homes filled with synthetic
        fragrances, cleaning chemicals, off-gassing materials, and stagnant airflow. Because you breathe all day
        (and your pets do too), improving air quality is one of the highest-impact wellness upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with the basics: ventilation, fewer fragranced products, and smarter choices for what you bring
        into your home. For additional support, air filters can be a helpful tool — but they’re not a replacement
        for reducing the source of the problem.

    <section id="fire" class="section">
      <h2>🔥 Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Natural sunlight is a biological signal — not just “vitamin D.” Light influences mood, hormones, sleep,
        and metabolism. Modern life keeps us indoors under artificial lighting that can be flickery, overly blue,
        and disconnected from how humans evolved to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest upgrade is more natural light exposure during the day and calmer lighting at night. When
        you can’t control the sun, you can still improve indoor lighting choices in ways that support your
        circadian rhythm.

    </section>

    <section id="earth" class="section">
      <h2>🌍 Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Humans evolved in constant contact with the earth, but modern life separates us from that connection —
        especially through insulated homes and rubber-soled shoes. Grounding (direct skin contact with the earth)
        is a simple practice many people find calming and regulating for the nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to make it complicated. Bare feet on grass, sand, or soil — even for a few minutes —
        can be a powerful reset.
