  <h1><span class="emoji">🌿</span> Brandy’s Trusted Wellness Picks</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my carefully curated collection of clean living recommendations—based on years of trial, error, and a relentless quest to live as toxin-free, grounded, and naturally well as possible. These are the people, products, tools, and ideas that have helped me reset my body and mind—and I hope they help you too. <span class="emoji">💚</span></p>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🥗</span> Clean Eating</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Green Juju</strong> — These aren’t just healthy brands—they’re part of a movement toward soil health, animal welfare, regenerative agriculture, and food as medicine.</li>
    <li><strong>Farmers Juice</strong> — Organic, cold-pressed juices with adaptogens and superfoods. Delivered frozen to preserve nutrients.</li>
    <li><strong>Live Spring Water</strong> or <strong>Mountain Valley Spring Water</strong> — I drink mountain spring water delivered in glass from local sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Raw Milk</strong> — Sourced from local grass-fed farms. Nutrient-dense, gut-friendly, and completely unprocessed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🐾</span> Pet Wellness</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OC Raw Rabbit & Produce (dog formula)</strong> — Despite the label, it's perfectly cat-safe. I use it as the base of their diet.</li>
    <li><strong>Green Juju Rabbit Bites & Trainers</strong> — Single-ingredient, freeze-dried raw rabbit. My cats “go feral” for these.</li>
    <li><strong>SmallBatch Pets Bone Broth</strong> — Clean, nourishing topper. I rotate flavors to support digestion and hydration.</li>
    <li><strong>Bones & Co. Goat Milk</strong> — Fermented, raw, and made with clean ingredients. Another great hydration booster.</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon & Lavender Rabbit Fur Toys</strong> — Ethically sourced, non-toxic, handmade. My cats’ absolute favorite toys.</li>
    <li><strong>Paws Evolution</strong> (run by Aleksandra Topic) — My trusted local shop. Aleks tests and vets everything herself.</li>
    <li><strong>Article coming soon:</strong> Marketing has completely disrupted how we feed our babies—and it’s making them sick. I’ll share what I’ve uncovered and how to feed for species-appropriate wellness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🧼</span> Cleaning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Branch Basics</strong> — Safe, plant-based, and minimalist. I use: Dishwasher Tablets, Laundry Detergent, and Multi-purpose Cleaner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="emoji">🏡</span> Home Goods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ratio Eight Coffee Maker</strong> — All-metal and glass water path (no plastic), sleek aesthetic, and perfect pour-over taste. Healthy <em>and</em> more beautiful than anything else I researched.</li>
    <li><strong>Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker</strong> (NP-NWC10) — Ceramic nonstick coated with platinum (instead of PTFE/Teflon). Even cooking, less toxin exposure, and Japanese engineering at its finest.</li>
  </ul>
