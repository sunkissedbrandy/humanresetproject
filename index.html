        Welcome to my carefully curated collection of clean living recommendations—based on years of trial,
        error, and a relentless quest to live as toxin-free, grounded, and naturally well as possible.
        My goal is to make this simple, practical, and doable — not overwhelming.

      <h2>🌊 Water</h2>
      <p>
        Hydration isn’t just about drinking “more water” — it’s about the quality of water your body receives.
        Natural spring water comes packed with minerals that support cellular hydration and balance. In contrast,
        modern tap water can contain disinfectant byproducts, industrial contaminants, and other additives that
        may not align with long-term wellness goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to panic or become perfect. A simple upgrade is to prioritize cleaner water and rebuild
        mineral intake in a way that feels sustainable.

    <section id="air" class="section">
      <h2>🌬️ Air</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor air — especially in modern homes filled with synthetic
        fragrances, cleaning chemicals, off-gassing materials, and stagnant airflow. Because you breathe all day
        (and your pets do too), improving air quality is one of the highest-impact wellness upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with the basics: ventilation, fewer fragranced products, and smarter choices for what you bring
        into your home. For additional support, air filters can be a helpful tool — but they’re not a replacement
        for reducing the source of the problem.

    <section id="fire" class="section">
      <h2>🔥 Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Natural sunlight is a biological signal — not just “vitamin D.” Light influences mood, hormones, sleep,
        and metabolism. Modern life keeps us indoors under artificial lighting that can be flickery, overly blue,
        and disconnected from how humans evolved to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest upgrade is more natural light exposure during the day and calmer lighting at night. When
        you can’t control the sun, you can still improve indoor lighting choices in ways that support your
        circadian rhythm.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="earth" class="section">
      <h2>🌍 Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Humans evolved in constant contact with the earth, but modern life separates us from that connection —
        especially through insulated homes and rubber-soled shoes. Grounding (direct skin contact with the earth)
        is a simple practice many people find calming and regulating for the nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to make it complicated. Bare feet on grass, sand, or soil — even for a few minutes —
        can be a powerful reset.
