  <h2><span class="emoji">🐾</span> Pet Wellness</h2>

  <p>
    Commercial pet food—especially kibble—is actually a very recent invention, emerging during World War II
    when metal cans were redirected to the war effort and manufacturers needed a shelf-stable product that
    could be packaged cheaply and stored indefinitely.
  </p>

  <p>
    While dogs and cats can survive on these ultra-processed diets, they are not biologically designed to
    thrive on them. Both species evolved to eat moisture-rich, animal-based foods, yet kibble is typically
    dehydrated, high in processed carbohydrates, and made with lower-quality ingredients that are heavily
    altered by extreme heat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, this disconnect between biology and diet can quietly impact digestion, metabolic health,
    immune function, skin, urinary health, and overall vitality—especially for cats, who are obligate
    carnivores and require a diet centered almost entirely on animal protein and fat.
  </p>

  <p>
    A biologically appropriate raw or minimally processed diet better aligns with how dogs and cats are
    designed to eat, supporting hydration, nutrient absorption, and long-term health. For those able and
    willing, transitioning gradually toward raw—or simply incorporating higher-quality, moisture-rich foods
    alongside existing diets—can be a meaningful step toward improving a pet’s health without needing to be
    all-or-nothing.
