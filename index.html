Welcome to my carefully curated collection of clean living recommendations—based on years of trial, error, and a relentless quest to live as toxin-free, grounded, and naturally well as possible. These are the people, products, tools, and ideas that have helped me reset my body and mind—and I hope they help you, too 💚

## 🥗 Clean Eating
These aren’t just healthy brands—they’re part of a movement toward soil health, animal welfare, regenerative agriculture, and food as medicine.

- **Green Juju** — The only packaged food my pets eat. My go-to for clean, raw rabbit treats (like the Rabbit Bites and Trainers).
- **Farmers Juice** — Organic, cold-pressed juices with adaptogens and superfoods. Delivered frozen to preserve nutrients.
- **Spring Water** — I drink mountain spring water delivered in glass from local sources via **Live Spring Water** or **Mountain Valley Spring Water**.
- **Raw Milk** — Sourced from local grass-fed farms whenever I can. Nutrient-dense, gut-friendly, and completely unprocessed.

## 🐾 Pet Wellness
This isn’t just a category—it’s a mission. So much pet food is garbage disguised as premium. Here’s what I’ve learned (and what I trust).

- **OC Raw Rabbit & Produce (dog formula)** — Despite the label, it’s perfectly cat-safe. I use it as the base of their diet.
- **Green Juju Rabbit Bites & Trainers** — Single-ingredient, freeze-dried raw rabbit. My cats *go feral* for these.
- **SmallBatch Pets Bone Broth** — Clean, nourishing topper. I rotate flavors to support digestion and hydration.
- **Bones & Co. Goat Milk** — Fermented, raw, and made with clean ingredients. Another great hydration booster.
- **Lemon & Lavender Rabbit Fur Toys** — Ethically sourced, non-toxic, handmade. My cats’ absolute favorite toys.
- **Paws Evolution (by Aleksandra Topic)** — My trusted local shop. Aleks tests and vets everything herself.
- **📰 Article coming soon:** Marketing has completely disrupted the way we feed our fur babies—and it’s making them sick. I’ll share what I’ve uncovered and how to feed for species-appropriate wellness.

## 🧼 Cleaning
If I could only recommend *one* swap to start detoxing your home, this would be it.

- **Branch Basics** — Safe, plant-based, and versatile. I use:
  - Dishwasher Tablets
  - Laundry Detergent
  - Multi-Purpose Cleaner

## 🏡 Home Goods
Because our homes should support healing, not silently harm us. These tools help me live clean, caffeinated, and calm.

- **Ratio Eight Coffee Maker** — All-metal and glass water path (no plastic), sleek aesthetic, and perfect pour-over taste. Healthier *and* more beautiful than anything else I researched (and you know I researched).
- **Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker (NP-NWC10)** — Ceramic nonstick coated with platinum (instead of PTFE/Teflon). Even cooking, less toxin exposure, and Japanese engineering at its finest.

## 🧴 Oral Health
Simple swaps, huge impact. Ditch the fluoride and synthetic flavors for truly clean oral care.

- **Simply O3 Ozone Pulling Solution** — Ozonated oil blend to support oral detox and gum health

## 👕 Clean Clothing
Soft on your skin, kind to the planet. Here are some wardrobe wins I’ve loved wearing (and living in).

- **Faherty** — Organic cotton, linen, hemp and other natural fabrics for women and men. Beachy, breathable, and thoughtfully made.

## 🎬 Documentaries That Changed Me
These opened my eyes—and rewired my habits.

- **The Devil We Know** — How DuPont’s chemicals poisoned a town—and the world.
- **Dark Waters** — Based on the real-life PFAS crisis. Must-watch.
- **Kiss the Ground** — Soil health, regenerative farming, and the path to planetary healing.
