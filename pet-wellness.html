    <section class="section">
      <h2>🐾 Pet Wellness</h2>

      <p>
        Commercial pet food—especially kibble—is actually a very recent invention, emerging during World War II
        when metal cans were redirected to the war effort and manufacturers needed a shelf-stable product that
        could be packaged cheaply and stored indefinitely.
      </p>

      <p>
        While dogs and cats can survive on these ultra-processed diets, they are not biologically designed to
        thrive on them. Both species evolved to eat moisture-rich, animal-based foods, yet kibble is typically
        dehydrated, high in processed carbohydrates, and made with lower-quality ingredients that are heavily
        altered by extreme heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, this disconnect between biology and diet can quietly impact digestion, metabolic health,
        immune function, skin, urinary health, and overall vitality—especially for cats, who are obligate
        carnivores and require a diet centered almost entirely on animal protein and fat.
      </p>

      <p>
        A biologically appropriate raw or minimally processed diet better aligns with how dogs and cats are
        designed to eat, supporting hydration, nutrient absorption, and long-term health. For those able and
        willing, transitioning gradually toward raw—or simply incorporating higher-quality, moisture-rich foods
        alongside existing diets—can be a meaningful step toward improving a pet’s health without needing to be
        all-or-nothing.

    <!-- HUMAN-GRADE -->
    <section class="section section-break">
      <h3>🍖 Why “Human-Grade” Matters</h3>

      <p>
        According to holistic veterinarians like Dr. Karen Becker, a significant portion of conventional
        commercial pet food is made using ingredients that were rejected from the human food supply and diverted
        into pet food instead. These ingredients may still contain pesticide residues, mycotoxins (from
        mold-contaminated grains), or degraded proteins — yet are legally permitted in pet food due to looser
        regulatory standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Human-grade pet food is different. It means the ingredients are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sourced from suppliers approved for human consumption</li>
        <li>Prepared in human food facilities</li>
        <li>Held to higher standards for freshness, cleanliness, and traceability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Feeding human-grade or gently cooked/raw foods doesn’t require perfection — even partial upgrades can
        significantly reduce a pet’s toxic and inflammatory burden over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ESSENTIAL OILS -->
    <section class="section section-break">
      <h3>🌿 Essential Oils & Pets: Safety First</h3>

      <p>
        Essential oils are powerful plant compounds — and while some can be supportive, many are unsafe or even
        toxic for pets, especially cats. Cats lack certain liver enzymes needed to process concentrated plant
        oils, making them particularly sensitive.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Generally considered safer options (when properly diluted and used cautiously):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frankincense</li>
        <li>Lavender (true lavender, not blends)</li>
        <li>Copaiba</li>
        <li>Helichrysum</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Common oils to avoid around pets:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tea tree (melaleuca)</li>
        <li>Eucalyptus</li>
        <li>Peppermint</li>
        <li>Clove</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Citrus oils</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Essential oils should never be applied directly to pets, diffused in enclosed spaces, or used without
        proper education. Less is more — and when in doubt, skip them entirely.
      </p>

    <!-- 5 STEPS -->
    <section class="section section-break">
      <h3>🐶🐱 5 Simple Steps to Improve Your Pet’s Health</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Upgrade water quality</strong><br />
          Provide filtered or spring water instead of tap to reduce chlorine, heavy metals, and chemical residues.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add fresh food to the bowl</strong><br />
          Even small additions — fresh meat, sardines, eggs, or gently cooked foods — improve nutrient density
          and hydration.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rotate proteins</strong><br />
          Avoid feeding the same protein every day to reduce food sensitivities and support a more resilient
          immune system.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choose non-toxic cleaners & bedding</strong><br />
          Pets live close to the floor and groom themselves — reducing chemical cleaners, fragrances, and treated
          fabrics matters.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Support the body, not just symptoms</strong><br />
          Focus on gut health, mineral balance, movement, sunlight, and emotional wellbeing — the foundations
          that allow healing to happen.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- BIG PICTURE -->
    <section class="section section-break">
      <h3>🧡 The Big Picture</h3>

      <p>
        Pet wellness isn’t about chasing trends or achieving perfection — it’s about reducing unnecessary stress
        on the body and supporting biology the way nature intended. When we clean up what our pets eat, drink,
        breathe, and rest on, we often see improvements not just in lifespan, but in energy, behavior, digestion,
        skin, and overall quality of life.
