      <h2>Support Our Local Farmers — Support Our Future</h2>
      <div class="kicker">Our food system is struggling — and so are the people who grow our food.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Main narrative -->
    <div class="card">
      <p>Our food system is struggling — and so are the people who grow our food.</p>

      <p>Over the past several decades, the economics of farming have shifted dramatically. Farmers once earned a sustainable share of the food dollar; now, many struggle just to stay in business. According to farmers and advocates featured in The Chemical Within: Glyphosate &amp; Us (Farmers Footprint), a farmer’s share of every food dollar has dropped sharply, squeezing livelihoods and driving thousands of farms out of business each year. Today, agriculture has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession — a heartbreaking indicator that our food system isn’t working for the people who feed us.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>But this crisis isn’t just economic — it’s ecological and nutritional.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Why Local Matters</h3>

      <p>Our food doesn’t just feed our bodies — it connects us to the land and the people who cultivate it. When we buy food that has traveled thousands of miles and sat in storage or on shelves for months, we lose:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Freshness and flavor</li>
        <li>Nutrient density — vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients begin to break down within days of harvest</li>
        <li>Connection to seasonality, place, and community</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Apples, greens, and produce at large grocery stores can sometimes be months old before you buy them — meaning you’re eating food that has lost much of its nutritional value before it even reaches your plate.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Soil Health Is Human Health</h3>

      <p>The industrial farming model that dominates global agriculture relies heavily on chemical inputs like glyphosate and synthetic fertilizers. While these practices were marketed as advancements in the mid-20th century, we now face the consequences: degraded soils, weakened plants, and nutrient–poor food. Our soil is the foundation of our food — and if the soil is depleted, the food grown in it will be too.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Voting With Our Dollars</h3>

      <p>Supporting local farmers — whether they are organic, regenerative, or transitioning toward more ecological practices — is one of the most impactful actions we can take. When we choose local and seasonal food:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We support farmers economically, helping them stay in business and reinvest in healthier land stewardship.</li>
        <li>We reduce transport time and storage, meaning fresher, more nourishing food on your table.</li>
        <li>We strengthen community connections — conversations, relationships, trust, and mutual support grow at farmers markets and local farms.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <p>This is more than just about food — it’s about reclaiming a system that nurtures both the health of the land and the well-being of the people who work it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Actions -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>What You Can Do Today</h2>

      <p>✔ Visit a local farmers market<br />
         ✔ Join a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture)<br />
         ✔ Ask your grocer where produce is sourced from<br />
         ✔ Choose seasonal, locally grown fruits and vegetables<br />
         ✔ Support farm stands and small producers</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Every dollar we spend on local food is a vote for a healthier future — for our bodies, our communities, and the people who feed us.</p>
