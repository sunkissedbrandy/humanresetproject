      <h2>🦷 Oral Health</h2>

      <p>
        Oral health isn’t just about teeth — it’s deeply connected to inflammation, heart health, immunity,
        and even how well the body detoxifies. Modern products can introduce unnecessary chemicals (especially
        flavorings, dyes, and certain preservatives), and many people overlook how often oral tissues absorb
        what we put in our mouths.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is simple: support healthy gums and a healthy microbiome with clean tools and ingredients —
        without overcomplicating the routine.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: Deep Education -->
    <section class="section section-break">
      <h3>Oral Health: The Gateway to Whole-Body Health</h3>

      <p>
        Modern dentistry tends to treat the mouth as if it exists in isolation — separate from the rest of the body.
        But emerging research and biological dentistry tell a very different story: the mouth is one of the most
        influential gateways to systemic health. Each tooth is connected to specific organs, muscles, glands,
        and meridian pathways through the nervous system and fascia. When something is off in the mouth —
        a chronic infection, an unresolved extraction site, or toxic materials — the effects can ripple far
        beyond teeth and gums.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, complications from wisdom tooth extractions, root canals, or hidden jawbone infections
        can quietly interfere with the body’s ability to heal elsewhere. Symptoms that seem unrelated —
        fatigue, autoimmune issues, hormone imbalances, chronic inflammation — may actually be influenced
        by unresolved oral stress. The body is not compartmentalized, and healing rarely happens in silos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Material choice matters too. Traditional metal (amalgam) fillings contain mercury and other metals
        that can disrupt the nervous system, immune function, and detox pathways — especially in people
        already dealing with chronic illness. While these materials were once considered “safe,” we now
        understand that long-term, low-level exposure can contribute to systemic burden, particularly in
        a body already under stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        True oral health goes beyond brushing and flossing. It’s about supporting the mouth as part of the
        whole organism — prioritizing biocompatible materials, proper jaw alignment, healthy breathing,
        mineral balance, and addressing root causes instead of masking symptoms. When oral health is
        respected as a foundational pillar of wellness, the body is finally given the chance to heal more
        completely, more efficiently, and more intelligently.
